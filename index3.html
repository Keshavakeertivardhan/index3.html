        <p>Sir Isaac Newton (/ˈnjuːtən/; 4 January [O.S. 25 December] 1643 – 31 March [O.S. 20 March] 1727)[a] was an English polymath active as a mathematician, physicist, astronomer, alchemist, theologian, and author.[5] Newton was a key figure in the Scientific Revolution and the Enlightenment that followed.[6] His book Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy), first published in 1687, achieved the first great unification in physics and established classical mechanics.[7][8] Newton also made seminal contributions to optics, and shares credit with German mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz for formulating infinitesimal calculus, though he developed calculus years before Leibniz.[9][10] He contributed to and refined the scientific method, and his work is considered the most influential in bringing forth modern science.[11][12][13][14][15]

        <p>Isaac Newton was one of the world's great scientists because he took his ideas, and the ideas of earlier scientists, and combined them into a unified picture of how the universe works. Isaac explained the workings of the universe through mathematics. He formulated laws of motion and gravitation.

        <p>Newton was not a man of romance, and he never married, nor did he appear to have any lovers, but what we can see in his relationship with Queen Anne is that he held her in high regard and had the utmost respect for her.

        <p>We also have Newton to thank for our high school calculus classes, as he developed the techniques of integration and differentiation that are still used to this day.22 Oct 2024
